- Background color: Very light lavender (#F2E7FA), close in hue to the primary color, but desaturated for a subtle, clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#29E3EC), chosen for being an analogous hue that adds brightness and energy, creating a vivid contrast against the purple and lavender tones.
